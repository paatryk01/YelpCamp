YelpCamp is a project built using HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, MongoDB, Node.js, Express.js 

On this website is possible to create an account and login using Passport.js

After that it's possible to add some campgrounds, comments, see other users and like comments or campgrounds.

The project is still being improved because few options aren't working correctly. Actaully "Search" isn't working.

Every user, campground, comment etc. is saved in MongoDB (database).
